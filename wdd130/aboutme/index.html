    <p>Hello everyone! Right now I am working full-time and going to school to become someone wokring with cyber security.
        I am married and have a wonderful wife that love to do do nails for a job! I love to play sports and hang out with 
        with my fmaily and friends.</p>
    <p>The reason I started into this type of school is that my brother is currently doing the same excat thing and I 
        thought to myself, "I think  might like this". As of right  now I think I will go with this very far.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church since I was a lee boy. I served a mission during covid and ended up going to three diffrent places.
        I started in Georgia, then went to Belize, and then I went to El Salvador.
        One quote or scripture that I like is when Nephi talks about going and doing
        what the Lord commands and I belive that all of us should do the same thing.</p>
