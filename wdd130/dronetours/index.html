        <p>Hello my name is Owen and I run a business of drone video and photagraphy. I got into this field of work ever
            since my senior year of highschool. I have been using my drone to take videos and photos of people's land
            and any part of there house for the past three year and I really enjoy the work that I do. I hope you do as
            well!</p><video src="images/mainvid.mp4" autoplay="" muted="" controls=""></video>

            a house or propety will help your listing go from normal to greatness.</p>As you browes your options, here
        you will be able to see great expample and just how good of work and how diffrent your listing can be with the
        help of a handy drone. You can also find what packages and prices that you will need to make your next house or
        property listing greater than the rest.
